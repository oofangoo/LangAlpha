"""PTC (Programmatic Tool Calling) workflow — async SSE generator.

This module contains the ``astream_ptc_workflow`` async generator, refactored
from the monolithic ``chat_handler.py``.  Request preparation, persistence,
error handling, and streaming logic is delegated to ``request_prep`` and
``services.runs.admission``; PTC-specific concerns (workspace session,
sandbox, background subagent orchestration, completion callback)
remain inline.
