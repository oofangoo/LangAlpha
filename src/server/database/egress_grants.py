"""
Database layer for sandbox egress grants — the relay's contract.

A grant binds (user, workspace, credential) to one exact destination captured
at creation. The relay authorizes every request with one query here; grant or
connection status flips deny the next request with no sandbox convergence.

Two kinds share the table, and they differ only in what resolves the
credential: ``oauth_mcp`` names the connection whose token the relay spends,
``header_mcp`` names the catalog row whose own headers it sends. Neither
stores a credential value; the grant stores the *reference*, so a rotated
secret and a revoked connection both take effect on the next request rather
than on the next sync.

    The denial names the curated tools whose group the user declined, so

    The permitted set is derived alongside it and written to the old

    is what the previous version enforces, and both versions serve at once
    through a blue/green cutover -- so writing only the denial left the draining
    colour reading a policy frozen at the last deploy, still honouring a group
    the user had since declined. The two disagree on an uncurated tool (the
    allowlist refuses it, the denylist permits it), and the stricter reading is
    the right one to hand a version on its way out.

    The fifth array is the direct-only set: granted tools bound to the model

    path per tool holds at the choke point and not only in the composite.

    Narrowing consent has to bite when the user confirms it, not when something
    later happens to resolve. A reconnect writes the new keys onto the
    connection and then leans on a version bump plus a best-effort re-apply to
    reach the grants -- and the relay reads the grant, not the connection. So a
    user who reconnected specifically to switch trading *off* kept an agent that
    could place orders: for as long as the proactive apply took, and
    indefinitely if it failed, since its failure is a warning log.

    Cheap enough to be unconditional (one UPDATE keyed on an indexed column) and
    idempotent, so it costs a widening reconnect nothing to run it too. The
    later sync stays: this converges the grants that exist right now, and that
    is a different question from which grants a workspace should have.

    Takes the owner's grant-sync lock first, for the whole read-and-write.
    Without it the two overlap in the one order that loses: a sync reads the
    old consent, this narrows the grant, and the sync's upsert then writes the
    old policy back over it -- and there is no version bump left to make the
    sync notice, since it CASed successfully before any of this began. Under
    the lock the sync either commits entirely before this reads, or reads the
    consent this connect already wrote. The consent is therefore re-read below,
    under the lock, rather than carried in from the query that found the owner.

    One lock over the user, not one per workspace. Fencing the workspaces this
    query can see leaves out the one that matters most: a workspace being
    created right now holds no grant, appears in no enumeration, and its first
    sync is exactly the writer that has read the old consent and not yet
    committed. There is no later pass to correct it, since the version bump has
    already gone out. Every grant sync takes this lock before its own
    per-workspace one, so the order is fixed and no cycle can form.

    ``conn`` joins the caller's transaction. The connect callback passes the one
    it wrote the connection row on, so the consent and the policy enforcing it
    land together.

    direct path stays callable from a sandbox already holding one, and a tool
    moved back off it stays refused, until whenever the next sync happens to
    run.

    Idempotent, and a row with no header grant pays one UPDATE that matches
    nothing; the lookup runs on (user_id, kind, server_name), which no index
    leads with yet, so it is a scan of a table that only ever grows by the
    workspace count. ``conn`` joins the caller's transaction,
