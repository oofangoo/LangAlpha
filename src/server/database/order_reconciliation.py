"""The reads and the guarded writes reconciliation makes on the order ledger.

Separate from ``order_attempts`` because the two ask opposite questions. That
module is the authorization path: one attempt at a time, addressed by id, each
transition guarded on the state the caller believes it is in. This one sweeps:
it looks across users for rows nobody is holding, and it writes what a vendor
said long after the turn that placed the order has gone.

The write is forward-only by construction. ``record_observation`` derives the
states a row may currently be in from the state being written, and a terminal
state is in nobody's set -- so a settled attempt cannot be reopened by a late
list read, and a row that moved on between the read and the write keeps
whichever answer got further.
