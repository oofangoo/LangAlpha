# Path-style file serving (`/api/v1/wsfiles/g/<grant>/...`)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Gives `.html` deliverables true served semantics: a document served at
# `/wsfiles/g/<grant>/work/task/report.html` can reference `charts/foo.png`
# and the browser resolves it relatively under the same prefix. The grant is
# the credential: signed for the owner, expiring, and minted only by an
# authenticated route (``services/file_grants``). Uniform 404 for a bad grant,
# a missing file and an unauthorized path alike, and never wake a stopped
# sandbox (denial-of-wallet protection).
#
# This is the owner's own viewer mechanism, NOT a sharing primitive: a grant
# opens the whole workspace. User-facing sharing goes through share links and
# permission-scoped thread-share tokens.

wsfiles_router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/v1", tags=["Workspace File Serving"])

# Short private cache: HTML reports and their assets are effectively immutable
# for a turn, so up to 60s of staleness on reload (until the next agent update
# is picked up) is an acceptable trade for far fewer sandbox/DB reads. The
# grant is a bearer credential, so we never allow shared/public caches to
# retain the bytes.
_WSFILES_CACHE_CONTROL = "private, max-age=60"

# Content-Security-Policy for served reports. Two jobs:
#   1. The `sandbox` directive forces an opaque origin even though the iframe
#      loads via `src=`, so agent/prompt-injected HTML can never reach app
#      cookies/localStorage. The popup tokens exist for embedded links: the
#      viewer-injected click handler (below) opens external links via
#      window.open(..., 'noopener'), and without the escape token the new tab
#      would inherit the sandbox — opaque origin, no cookies, so real sites'
#      bot checks break. A noopener'd external tab is the same reach a chat
#      markdown link already has. (The header intersects with the iframe's
#      sandbox attribute; both carry the tokens.)
#   2. The source directives cap egress to the html-report skill's CDN
#      allowlist. `connect-src 'none'` is the load-bearing block: no
#      fetch/XHR/beacon/websocket, so a prompt-injected report cannot exfiltrate
#      its own contents. The skill embeds data inline, so this costs nothing.
# `'self'` keeps relative subresources (charts/foo.png, app.js) working;
# `'unsafe-inline'` is required because reports inline their JS/CSS and the
# server splices an inline theme-sync script for `?inject=theme`. Google Fonts
# stays allowed for the CJK web-font path (Noto Sans SC/JP/KR -> tofu without it).
