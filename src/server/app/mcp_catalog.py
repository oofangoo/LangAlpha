"""User-level MCP server API — the Plugins backing store.

An ``enabled`` row is live config: ``resolve_mcp_config`` inherits it into
every one of the user's workspaces. A disabled row is inert — a stored
definition that reaches no workspace until it is enabled. Every route here is
owner-scoped, so responses echo the stored env/header maps as written — vault
refs and the owner's own literals, never a resolved secret — because a PUT
replaces the whole row and the edit form has to round-trip them.
``env_refs``/``header_refs`` remain the display-only vault-name projection.

Endpoints (user-scoped):
- GET    /api/v1/mcp/servers
- POST   /api/v1/mcp/servers
- POST   /api/v1/mcp/servers/probe
- POST   /api/v1/mcp/servers/import
- GET    /api/v1/mcp/servers/{name}
- GET    /api/v1/mcp/servers/{name}/tools
- PUT    /api/v1/mcp/servers/{name}
- PATCH  /api/v1/mcp/servers/{name}/enabled
- PATCH  /api/v1/mcp/servers/{name}/new-workspaces
- PATCH  /api/v1/mcp/servers/{name}/binding
- DELETE /api/v1/mcp/servers/{name}

The rest of the ``/api/v1/mcp`` prefix is not the user catalog and lives with
what it is about: ``mcp_builtin`` (this build's own servers), ``mcp_brokerages``
(the shipped connectors) and ``mcp_icons`` (the marks servers declare).
