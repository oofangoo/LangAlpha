"""Directly bound MCP tools: JSON tool calls from the model, through the relay.

The sandbox path hands the model a Python wrapper per MCP tool and lets it
compose them in ``ExecuteCode``. The direct path binds the tool itself, with
its vendor schema verbatim, so a call is one typed tool call the middleware
sees and the UI can render. Both paths reach the vendor through the same
egress grant and the same relay route: the host dials its own relay on
loopback with a relay JWT, so policy, token attach and audit are one code
path however the call arrived.

The relay sessions are opened inside the run, not the request. The graph is
driven by the run manager's task and outlives the request's generator when
the client drops, and the transport's session lives in the task that entered
it, so the sessions are entered and closed by ``drive`` around the run
stream itself. Between them the client is held open, so each call reuses
one session instead of paying a handshake through the relay.
