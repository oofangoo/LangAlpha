"""The egress relay's per-request pipeline: authenticate → authorize → attach
the vendor credential → stream the exchange through.

Stateless per request (``--workers N`` free): the sandbox proves itself with a
relay JWT, the grant row authorizes exactly one destination captured at grant
creation, and the vendor credential is resolved fresh from Postgres each call
(``credentials.py`` per kind), so rotation and revocation are instant by
construction, with zero sandbox convergence.

Header discipline is allowlist-both-ways: the sandbox's relay Authorization
never reaches the vendor; the vendor's Set-Cookie / WWW-Authenticate never
reach the sandbox.
