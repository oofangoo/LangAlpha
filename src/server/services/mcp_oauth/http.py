"""SSRF-pinned HTTP for OAuth hops (httpx2 — the SDK's request objects).

Every host-side request to a user-supplied URL (server probe, PRM, AS
metadata, DCR, token) goes through :func:`pinned_request`: the hostname is
resolved once, every address is required to be globally routable, and the
request is sent to the validated IP with the Host header + SNI restored — so a
DNS answer swapped between validation and connect cannot re-target the
request. Redirects are refused outright (fail closed), and the response body
is read under a byte cap and wall-clock deadline (fail closed again — the
read timeout alone is an idle timeout a trickling server resets forever).
