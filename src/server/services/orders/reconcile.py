"""Ask each brokerage what became of an order the host stopped watching.

Two things end an attempt that no turn will ever finish. A call that left the
relay and whose answer never came back leaves the row in ``submitting``, and
only the vendor knows whether an order exists behind it. An order that was
accepted and is still working leaves the row open, and it fills, or is
cancelled at the venue, with nobody in the loop to notice. Both are settled
here, by reading the vendor's own order list through the same egress relay a
direct tool call goes through, and writing the answer with a guarded UPDATE.

This job never places, changes or cancels anything. It calls read tools only,
and refuses to send one the capability map classifies as an order tool -- so
the relay's execution gate, which fires exactly on those, is never even
approached. Reconciliation therefore mints no execution token and needs none.

Two Postgres advisory locks, because the pass has two halves with different
costs. One runner per fleet holds the SQL-only head, where a second worker
would double-refuse a row or take the same candidates; the vendor calls that
follow are held per ``(user, server)`` instead, since that is the only scope
in which two workers ask one brokerage the same question. Those calls run
several accounts at a time under a bound of their own, which is what keeps a
deployment of one worker from reading a whole batch end to end, and each
account gets a deadline, since nothing else bounds a pass at all. Nothing is
cached between passes; the ledger row is the only state, and every write names
the states it is allowed to overtake.
