"""The brokerage connectors LangAlpha ships, and what makes each one unusual.

A brokerage is an ordinary user-tier MCP server with one thing held back from
the user: its endpoint. The address a broker's MCP server answers on is where
an OAuth token ends up, so it is named here in source rather than typed into a
form or seeded by a client — a stale build or a tampered page must not get to
answer "which host is Robinhood".

Everything past that first write is the generic catalog. Enabling one creates
the user's own row, which they can then edit, scope per workspace, disconnect,
or delete like any server they added themselves. Nothing here runs, and no row
exists, until someone turns one on.

The per-provider quirks are flags rather than sentences. The copy that explains
them is translated, so the wire carries the fact and the client owns the words.
