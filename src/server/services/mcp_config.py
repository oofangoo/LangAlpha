"""Per-workspace MCP configuration resolution — the single chokepoint.

Modeled on ``resolve_llm_config``. Merges the process-global built-in MCP
servers (from ``base_config.mcp.servers``), the user's enabled user-level
servers, and a workspace's selection rows into one deterministic effective set:

    effective = built-ins (config order)
                MINUS names disabled by a (source='builtin', enabled=false) row
                MINUS names disabled account-wide (server or owning bundle)
                PLUS  enabled user-level servers (alphabetical)
                MINUS names disabled by a (source='user', enabled=false) row

Servers are installed per user and selected per workspace, so a name means
the same server in every workspace of its user. Built-in names are reserved:
a user server can never shadow one.

User-level mutations bump every workspace of the user (one transaction), so
the single per-workspace ``mcp_config_version`` remains the only drift signal
sessions have to watch.

The merged list and the DB↔model converters are defined ONCE here so the API
effective-list endpoint and the sandbox-sync path can import the same logic
(no prompt/wrapper divergence).
