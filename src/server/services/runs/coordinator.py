"""Turn lifecycle v4 — RunCoordinator: the only code that transitions run state.

START happens eagerly at the HTTP boundary (before the StreamingResponse /
dispatch 202), so every accepted request has a durable in_progress attempt
row before any execution begins. Finalize is one CAS transaction — response
terminal + thread projection + usage + outbox — with post-commit transport
effects afterward. Every terminal path (complete, interrupt, error, cancel,
setup failure, abandoned generator) funnels through finalize_run; nothing
else may write a run's terminal state.
