"""The capability groups a brokerage connection can carry, and the tools in each.

A brokerage publishes one flat tool list, and connecting one hands the agent all
of it. These groups are the unit of consent instead: the user picks which ones a
connection carries, the choice is stored on the connection, and the egress relay
refuses a call to anything outside it.

The assignment is hand-made and has to stay that way, because a prefix rule gets
it wrong in both directions. moomoo's ``quote_modify_user_security`` writes the
watchlist despite reading like a quote, and IBKR's ``provide_customer_feedback``
sends a message to the broker despite reading like nothing at all.

The policy regulates what is curated and does not block what is not: a tool in
no capability group is permitted, so a vendor publishing one between our
releases reaches the agent rather than being refused until a deploy catches up.
That is a deliberate trade. It is also why ``UNCURATED`` is a list rather than
an omission -- the second tool above is one we read and chose to keep away, and
that decision has to be written down somewhere the denial can see it, or "we
never classified this" and "we classified this and said no" become the same
state and the second one wins the wrong way.

The rungs below ``trading`` are three different things, not one, which is why
they are three groups. moomoo's ``sim_trade_*`` is **paper trading**: a parallel
simulated account with its own cash, positions and order history, unable to
touch real money. Robinhood's ``review_*_order`` is an **order preview**: a
computation against the real account that returns pre-trade alerts and persists
nothing, which is why it has no list or delete counterpart. IBKR's
``*_order_instruction`` is a **staged order**: a full create/list/delete triple
that writes an object into the real account, one human click from being live --
IBKR's own description draws the line for us, saying an instruction "is not a
live order".

Folding them into one group would cost the display its vocabulary. The badge on
the row and the switch in the consent dialog read the same key, so a single
group would have to be labelled something true of all three and precise about
none of them.

Asset class is not one of these axes. A vendor's crypto order tools file under
the same rungs as its equity ones, because a group answers what an action
costs rather than what it trades, and ``trading`` has always carried equities,
options and option exercise together. Granting crypto separately would need a
second axis that neither the ladder nor the badges have.

A second map, ``_ORDER_TOOLS``, names the tools that create, change, cancel,
confirm, stage, unstage or exercise an order. It is per tool rather than per
group because ``paper_trading`` mixes three mutating tools with five reads, so
a group-level pin would drag a position list onto the direct path for nothing.
Every one of these binds ``direct`` and nothing on the row can move it: a JSON
tool call is one interceptable event per order, which is what a per-call stop
and an order surface need, while a sandbox wrapper can place any number inside
a single execution.

That map is also the single declaration of what each order tool *is*. The
vendor adapters read the same entries to dispatch a call, so what a tool does,
whose money it does it with and what it trades are stated once here rather than
restated per adapter, where a table that drifted would gate one tool and parse
another.

Keys are facts and the words for them belong to the client, the same contract
``brokerages.py`` keeps.

    list, and a connector that silently stops working when the vendor ships an

    a denial that comes out empty serves everything and looks healthy. That is
