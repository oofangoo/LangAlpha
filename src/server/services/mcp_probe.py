"""Credential-agnostic host-side probe of a remote MCP server.

One network routine for everything that asks a remote server what it offers
from this process: the OAuth refresh (a bearer from the token store), the
catalog discovery for header-auth and open servers (the row's own headers,
vault refs resolved), and the add form's check of an address nothing has
saved yet.

The SDK folds a 4xx on the handshake into a generic JSON-RPC error, so the
status that says *why* a server refused is read by a preflight ``initialize``
POST before the SDK session runs. That preflight is also the only place a
server's auth requirement is observable: a 401 with OAuth metadata behind it
is OAuth; a 401/403 without is some credential we were not given; a listing
that succeeds without credentials is open. A server that checks its key only
inside tool results looks open to every probe, and nothing here pretends
otherwise.

The single word every surface renders is computed here too, by
:func:`probe_verdict`. It needs the status, the challenge behind it and
whether a credential was sent, and this is the only place holding all three.
