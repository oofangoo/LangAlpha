"""Workspace Manager: the project-facing façade over ``ComputerManager``.

A workspace is a project; the machine it runs on is a computer. Everything
keyed by machine -- the session cache, the locks, the sandbox lifecycle --
lives in ``ComputerManager``; what is left here is the project-shaped API the
routes and the agent call, plus the two operations that are genuinely about a
project rather than a machine: creating one and deleting one.
