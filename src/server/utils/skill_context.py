"""
Skill context utilities for the chat endpoint.

Pure request-parsing helpers: extract ``SkillContext`` items from a request's
``additional_context`` and detect ``/command`` prefixes in the message text.
Body loading + inline injection live in ``ptc_agent`` (``SkillsMiddleware``);
the server only resolves *which* skills the turn requested.
