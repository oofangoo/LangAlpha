"""The per-thread baseline: one frozen context block, re-rendered byte-identically.

Everything here used to be read on every model call by three separate
middlewares, each appending its own system block. Between the static prefix and
the conversation, that meant every agent.md write re-wrote the entire message
history at the write rate instead of the read rate.

The baseline instead reads once per turn in ``before_agent``, freezes the result
into checkpoint state, and re-renders from that state on every call. What the
model sees is stable for an epoch, so a cache breakpoint can sit on it. What
changed underneath reaches the model as a durable row written into history
(see ``epoch.py`` and ``durable.py``), not as an edit to a block it already has.

An epoch survives until compaction, because compaction is the one event that can
remove the block from the model's retained history: "the file did not change" is
not enough after a summarization dropped the injection it is measured against.

The split of work is the point. This module does the IO and the rendering; the
record itself, and the decision between rebuilding it and filing rows against
it, are pure and live in ``epoch.py``.

        timezone: The turn's zone, which the identity block states ahead of

        guidance: Resolved prompt guidance level; None resolves it lazily.
        model_name: Model the turn resolved to, used only for guidance.
        rebuild_after_updates: Durable rows since the last epoch that force a

        read_timeout_s: Ceiling on any one turn-boundary read.
        files_mounted: Whether the file mount served as the agent was built,
            which a rebuild freezes for the static prompt to state. None for
            a build whose prompt says nothing about the mount.
        role: The role the agent runs in, for the wording of the blocks that
