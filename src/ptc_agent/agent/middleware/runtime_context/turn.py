"""The turn's opening context, written once into history.

This used to be four sections of the per-call envelope, re-rendered on every
model call of the turn. That was wrong twice over: the values are frozen for
the turn anyway, so the re-render cost tokens without changing a byte, and a
block that never survives the call left the model with no time line at all
across turns.

Written instead as one durable row at the turn boundary, the stamp becomes what
it always was: the turn's anchor, sitting at the point in the conversation where
the turn began, and readable from there for the rest of the thread. That is also
why every line is a fact rather than a countdown. "next open in 13h" is true for
one minute; "next open Thu 09:30 ET" is true forever.

The row also carries the delivery rules for the surface the turn arrived on.
Those used to be a static table of every surface in the cached system prefix,
which spent the rules for five surfaces on every turn of every thread so that
one of them could apply, and still could not say anything about the surface in
hand. Carried here they arrive on demand and only when they are news: a thread
that never leaves the web app states the web rules once, and a thread that
moves to another surface states that surface's rules on the turn it moves.

Which rules those are depends on who renders the reply. langalpha has a line of
its own for the surfaces it draws itself; for any other surface the client that
posted the turn sends its own text (``ChatRequest.surface_rules``) and that text
is the paragraph, because the client is what has to display the answer.
