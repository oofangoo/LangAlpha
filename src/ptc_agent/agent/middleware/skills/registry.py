Skill registry for dynamic tool loading.

This module defines the registry of available skills that can be dynamically
loaded by the agent via the load_skill mechanism. Each skill contains a set
of tools that are pre-registered but hidden until the skill is loaded.

    Attributes:
        name: Unique skill identifier
        description: Human-readable description of what the skill does
        tools: List of LangChain tools included in this skill
        tool_names: Names of externally-registered tools gated by this skill,
            for per-thread factory tools that can't be instantiated at import
            time (e.g. RunWorkflow). The tool object is registered by the agent
            factory; the skill only controls its visibility.
        switched_tools: Names of tools the agent binds without loading this
            skill but drops when the skill is switched off. Never hidden
            behind LoadSkill; listed with the skill so the Plugins page shows
            what its switch removes.
        skill_md_path: Where the agent reaches SKILL.md, not where the repo
            keeps it. A sandbox-relative suffix, matched against the reads
            the agent makes under ``.agents/skills/``, which the sync
            flattens every source into. A shipped skill's files live in the
            bundle that declares it; that path never appears here.
        exposure: Which agent mode(s) can use this skill ("ptc", "flash", or "both")
        system_gate: Deployment kill switch for skills owned by a config section
            rather than the feature catalog. False drops the skill everywhere.
        source_dir: Absolute host directory containing ``<name>/SKILL.md`` for
            user-tier skills. It lets the loader read the body without any
            ``skill_dirs`` search. None for platform skills.
        origin: Whose content this is. "user" entries get trust framing in the
            manifest and the user-tier wire shape in the API.
        requires: Names of registry skills this one reads at runtime. A
            required skill survives a disable of its own for as long as one
            skill declaring it is not itself disabled (see
            ``resolve_disabled_skills``).
