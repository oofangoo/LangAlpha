"""Feature-flag registry: code-declared catalog, deployment overrides, user opt-ins.

Each feature carries two orthogonal controls:

- ``enabled`` — the kill switch. ``false`` turns the feature off for everyone
  and hides every surface; the gate is irrelevant.
- ``gate`` — the access model while enabled:
    * ``none``    — available to everyone
    * ``opt_in``  — off until the user opts in (Settings toggle)
    * ``opt_out`` — on unless the user opts out (Settings toggle)
    * ``plan``    — requires a platform plan whose access tier meets the
      feature's ``min_tier`` (OSS/self-hosted deployments bypass plan gates,
      matching the search-provider tier-gating convention)

Three definition layers, resolved in order:

1. **Catalog** (this module): every feature the codebase knows about, with its
   hard defaults and the frontend-facing label/description. A feature must be
   declared here to exist anywhere else.
2. **Deployment posture** (``config.yaml`` ``features:`` section): per-deploy
   override of ``enabled`` / ``gate`` / ``min_tier``; unset fields inherit
   the catalog.
3. **User override** (``user_preferences.other_preference.feature_overrides``,
   server-side): honored only for ``opt_in``/``opt_out`` gates.

Server code resolves per-user via ``src.server.services.features``; this
module stays user-agnostic so the agent library can consult defaults.
