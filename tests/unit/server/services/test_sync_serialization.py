"""Contracts for the per-workspace fence around ``sync_to_db``.

A sync decides what to write from a manifest read taken before the sandbox
scan, then writes unconditionally minutes later. With ``--workers N`` two syncs
of one workspace can be in flight on different processes, and without a fence
the older pass's upsert lands last and reinstates rows the newer pass had
already superseded. Postgres holds the fence because it is the only thing all
the workers share.
