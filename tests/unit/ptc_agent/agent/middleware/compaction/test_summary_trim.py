"""A compaction that has to trim its input keeps the previous summary, and
each model it asks reads what its own window holds.

Trimming keeps the newest messages. After an earlier compaction the list
starts with that compaction's summary, the only copy of everything before it,
so a plain trim dropped it first and the new summary silently forgot the start
of the thread. The summary model is often the Background model, whose window
can be far smaller than the turn model's that falls back behind it, so each is
sent the history its window holds rather than one budget for both.
