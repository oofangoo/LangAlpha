 * two maps that could not see each other -- and unmounting a tab does not stop
 * the run it started. That run came back to a map where it was still the owner
 * and switched off a row the newer connect had just brought live.
 *
 * Nothing is ever released here, and releasing on the way out is what an
 * earlier attempt got wrong: absence is how the user taking the connect back is
 * told apart from a later connect taking it over, so a finished run deleting
 * its own claim made the next failure read as a cancel and undo work that was
