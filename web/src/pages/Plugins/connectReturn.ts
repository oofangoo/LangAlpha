 * What is owed to someone whose connect left this tab and never came back.

 * loopback callback on the user's own machine. They refuse a hosted one at the
 * authorize step, and a refusal there is silent by construction — the vendor's
 * page renders its own error and never redirects, so no code and no error ever
 * reaches us. The desktop shell can hold that listener and complete the flow; a
 * browser tab has nothing to offer.
 *
 * *Which* connectors those are is the brokerage registry's answer and whether
 * this build could finish one is `canBeginMcpOAuth`'s. Neither lives here. What
 * does is the part no advance note can cover: a provider can refuse for reasons
 * nobody listed, and the user is owed a sentence either way.
